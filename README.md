# Stock Market Tracker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that demonstrates a simple stock market tracker application. It allows users to search for any stock symbol and view its price history over the last 20 years in a graph.

## Features

- Search for stocks using their symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)
- Display stock price history in a line chart
- Dark mode support with a toggle button
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
